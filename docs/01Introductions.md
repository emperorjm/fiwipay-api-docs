# Introductions

The "**fiwiPay**" API is a REST based API that allows merchants to integrate fiwiPay into their web and mobile platforms.

In order to use the API a merchant account must be created at <https://www.fiwipay.com> (Production platform) or <https://developer.fiwipay.com> (Sandbox platform). Create a new "**Express**" merchant record which will generate a "**Client Id**" and "**Secret Key**" which are needed to authenticate and generate "**access tokens**" that are used to access the various available endpoints.
