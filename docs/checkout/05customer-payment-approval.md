On clicking the **Approve** button the following API URL would be executed: **customer/request_payments/approve/{id}**

Once approval is final the funds will be transferred from the customer to the merchant. If there are any issues an error will be returned to the customer stating the error.

On clicking the **Decline** button the following API URL would be executed: **customer/request_payments/decline/{id}**

Once the decline button is clicked the Payment Request and connected Invoice are set to "**Cancelled**".
